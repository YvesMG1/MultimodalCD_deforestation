# Comparing fusion techniques for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 in deforestation change detection

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc Thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich. In this project, we compare various deep learning architectures to improve deforestation change detection by fusing multimodal data from Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) imagery.

To replicate our results or evaluate on new data, follow the instructions below.

## 1. Data

The final dataset is available on: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19ilDM-GLARZzeTcCwYvBUlDq9ltgHl4I).

## 2. Training

You can train the models by running:

```bash
python src/training/main.py --config /models/configs/config_file.yaml
```

### Example usage:

```bash
python src/training/main.py --config /models/configs/config_ukr_cd.yaml
```

Make sure to specify the root path to your data folder in the configuration file.

## 3. Evaluation

All pretrained models are stored in `models/fitted_models`.

For evaluation and to visualize results, follow the instructions in:

```bash
notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in the `environment.yml` file.
